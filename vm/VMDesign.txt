- Constants and instructions randomly ordered in the bytecode (vm changes to properly run it)
- Lua Number is double
- Everything is little endian
- The whole bytecode string is encrypted with a key using one encryption method
- Everything is individually encrypted with another key using a more secure encryption method
- Instructions and Constants are encrypted with their own key and a more secure encryption method
- Encryption keys are stored in random places throughout the obfuscated code
- Garbage keys are thrown in randomly
